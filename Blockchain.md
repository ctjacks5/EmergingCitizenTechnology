# EmergingCitizenTechnology

Federal agencies are eager to better evaluate and adopt distributed ledger technologies (like blockchain) that use encryption and coding to improve transparency, efficiency and trust in information sharing. Blockchain use cases that agencies submit for exploration touch many parts and processes of an organization, including:

- Financial management
- Procurement
- IT asset and supply chain management
- Smart contracts
- Patents, Trademarks Copyrights, Royalties
- Government-issued credentials like visas, passports, SSN and birth certificates
- Federal personnel workforce data
- Appropriated funds
- Federal assistance and foreign aid delivery

GSA’s Emerging Citizen Technology program launched the U.S. Federal Blockchain program for federal agencies and U.S. businesses who are interested in exploring distributed ledger technology and its implementation within government.

We hosted the first U.S. Federal Blockchain Forum on July 18, 2017, uniting more than 100 federal managers from dozens of unique agencies to discuss use cases, limitations, and solutions. Agency teams submitted their own potential use cases for Blockchain technology to our current repository of almost 200 submissions.
