GSA TTS Emerging Citizen Technology Program

Next generation digital public services are powered by government data and artificial intelligence like chatbots and smart forms. The intelligent automation of programs helps make our public services more open, responsive, informative, and accessible for the American people.

GSA’s Emerging Citizen Technology Program launched the Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services program in October, 2016 to unite public service managers and innovative U.S. businesses in evaluating and building smart automation solutions. https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/11/30/sharing-public-service-visions-for-virtual-reality-and-artificial-intelligence/ 

We launched an open-source pilot that helped dozens of federal programs make their services available to consumer intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) like Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, and Facebook Messenger. We’re working with client agencies to prepare business cases understanding the impact of these advances in Artificial Intelligence on Citizen Services.
